# GPT Engineer


**Specify what you want it to build, the AI asks for clarification, and then builds it. Now all on the Web.**

GPT Engineer is made to be easy to adapt, extend, and make your agent learn how you want your code to look. It generates an entire codebase based on a prompt.

## Project philosophy

- Simple to get value
- Flexible and easy to add new own "AI steps". See `steps.py`.
- Incrementally build towards a user experience of:
  1. high level prompting
  2. giving feedback to the AI that it will remember over time
- Converting to a website for easier use.
- Fast handovers back and forth between AI and human
- Simplicity, all computation is "resumable" and persisted to the filesystem
